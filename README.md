1. Usually there is issue with filename of software update file. Please check again and again if the file is named "the_centre_v4.fwx"
2. File must be in the root (main) directory of SD-Card. Update file placed in any subdirectory cannot be found.
3. The SD-Card must be formatted as FAT or FAT32 filesystem. Other filesystems (including exFAT. NTFS, APFS, ext4) cannot be recogised.
4. Sometimes the SD-Card connector either in The Centre or on the SD-Card itself oxidises. Remove SD-Card and clean it with the rug. Remove and reinsert SD-Card 2-3 times and observe if the icon on the Screen "SD" turns from RED to GREEN.
5. Verify the version of installed firmware by entering System Menu (press buttons 2-3 simultaneously) and checking version of firmware
